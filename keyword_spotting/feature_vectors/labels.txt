MR.
Macmillan
has
picked
a
strong
"
brains
trust
"
team
to
negotiate
terms
for
joining
the
Common
Market
.
And
he
has
abandoned
plans
to
visit
President
de
Gaulle
this
month
to
smooth
the
way
.
General
de
Gaulle's
official
welcome
last
week
to
Britain's
moves
towards
the
Six
was
taken
as
a
friendly
gesture
in
Whitehall
,
but
no
more
than
that
.
So
the
idea
of
personal
mission
by
the
Prime
Minister
to
Paris
was
dropped
Instead
Mr.
Macmillan
will
rely
on
a
hand-picked
team
under
the
leadership
of
Sir
Pierson
Dixon
,
Britain's
Ambassador
to
France
,
to
back
Mr.
Edward
Heath
,
Lord
Privy
Seal
,
who
is
charged
with
the
conduct
of
negotiations
with
the
Six
.
At
the
same
time
the
Prime
Minister
has
offered
Commonwealth
Governments
every
facility
possible
to
safeguard
their
interests
Seven
Commonwealth
countries
have
told
Mr.
Sandys
,
Commonwealth
Relations
Secretary
,
that
they
wish
to
be
kept
in
touch
in
London
.
Three
of
them
-
Canada
,
Australia
,
New
Zealand
-
will
have
strong
delegations
at
an
opening
meeting
in
London
on
Monday
.
Once
the
Common
Market's
Council
of
Ministers
draws
up
the
procedure
for
negotiations
in
a
fortnight's
time
,
these
Commonwealth
countries
can
arrange
for
observers
to
advise
the
British
negotiating
team
.
The
team
is
composed
of
experienced
negotiators
in
several
fields
.
Sir
Pier-
son
Dixon
has
a
wide
reputation
as
a
skilful
backstage
negotiator
since
his
days
as
Britain's
chief
UN
dele-
gate
.
Second
in
command
is
Mr.
Eric
Roll
,
53-year-old
Deputy
Secre-
tary
at
the
Ministry
of
Agriculture
,
Food
,
and
Fisheries
.
The
Foreign
Office
is
represented
by
Sir
Roderick
Barclay
Other
leading
members
are
:
Sir
Henry
Lintott
from
the
Commonwealth
Relations
Office
,
Sir
William
Corell-Barnes
(
Colonial
Office
)
,
Mr.
G.
R.
Bell
(
Treasury
)
,
and
Mr.
G.
H.
Andrew
(
Board
of
Trade
)
.
They
will
accompany
Mr.
Heath
next
month
when
he
goes
to
Brussels
,
headquarters
of
the
Common
Market
Commission
,
or
wherever
the
Six
decide
negotiations
should
be
held
.
Some
of
the
problems
were
reviewed
yesterday
at
a
meeting
in
Paris
between
M.
Couve
de
Murville
,
French
Foreign
Minister
,
and
Mr.
Heath
.
MR.
Selwyn
Lloyd
-
a
man
with
troubles
enough
back
home
-
seems
fated
to
fly
into
trouble
abroad
.
Last
year
it
was
the
riots
in
Istanbul
,
which
enlivened
the
NATO
Council
meeting
.
Now
we
have
the
strikes
and
demonstrations
in
Ghana
coinciding
with
the
meeting
of
the
Com-
monwealth
Economic
Consultative
Council
-
the
first
to
be
held
in
Africa
.
Only
a
few
hours
af-
ter
Mr
Lloyd
and
his
24-strong
delegation
landed
at
Accra
this
morning
,
hundreds
of
shop
assistants
demonstrated
outside
the
British-owned
Kingsway
Stores
,
the
largest
in
town
.
The
stores
had
been
hit
by
the
same
strike
wave
that
has
paralysed
the
port
of
Takoradi
for
the
past
week
.
Root
of
the
discontent
:
The
austerity
Budget
,
including
a
compulsory
savings
scheme
which
the
Ghana
Government
introduced
in
July
.
Ghana's
strong
man
is
not
here
to
face
the
storm
.
President
Nkrumah
,
having
made
his
contribution
to
the
neutrals'
conference
in
Belgrade
,
has
resumed
his
holiday
on
the
Black
Sea
and
no
one
here
professes
to
know
when
he
will
return
.
But
in
his
absence
his
chief
lieutenants
have
not
let
him
down
.
The
strong
arm
of
authority
has
been
raised
against
the
strikers
and
is
now
beginning
to
tell
.
Today's
Ghanaian
Times
(
motto
:
"
The
welfare
of
the
people
is
the
supreme
law
"
)
reports
:
"
The
Government
has
been
urged
to
take
immediate
ac-
tion
to
deal
ruthlessly
with
the
strikers
.
"
The
urge
came
from
a
conference
of
activists
of
Nkrumah's
Convention
Party
"
after
powerful
addresses
by
Comrades
Krobo
Edusei
,
Tawia
Adamafio
,
"
and
others
.
Strong
deeds
followed
strong
words
.
In
Takoradi
a
"
limited
state
of
emergency
"
was
declared
,
giving
the
Government
adequate
power
to
maintain
all
essential
services
and
ensure
food
supplies
.
Thus
it
becomes
an
offence
punishable
with
imprisonment
for
anyone
who
"
publishes
a
report
likely
to
cause
alarm
or
prejudicial
to
public
safety
.
"
And
up
to
ten
years'
imprisonment
can
be
imposed
on
anyone
convicted
of
sabotage
.
These
stern
measures
had
the
desired
effect
today
at
Kumasi
where
the
strikers
gave
in
,
but
in
Takoradi
,
the
chief
storm
centre
,
they
are
still
holding
out
despite
the
presence
of
1,400
police
and
16
armoured
cars
.
And
how
did
the
Government
react
when
the
strikers
demonstrated
in
Accra
?
At
9.40
Mr.
Edusei
,
Minister
of
Transport
and
pro-
bably
the
toughest
man
in
Mr.
Nkrumah's
team
,
drove
up
to
the
Kingsway
Stores
and
faced
the
demonstrators
,
most
of
them
shopgirls
in
overalls
.
"
If
you
have
not
dispersed
by
ten
o'clock
,
"
he
told
them
,
'
the
police
will
act
.
'
At
five
to
ten
a
posse
of
police
arrived
and
in
less
than
two
minutes
the
crowd
had
gone
.
If
the
threatened
"
counter-revolution
"
was
not
*
to
bring
the
President
back
from
his
travels
it
might
have
been
thought
that
the
muster
from
the
13
States
of
the
Commonwealth
was
an
occasion
worthy
of
his
presence
.
After
all
it
was
Mr.
Nkrumah
who
suggested
that
this
year
the
Economic
Consultative
Council
should
meet
in
Accra
.
*
enough
It
has
been
left
,
however
,
to
Mr.
Goka
,
Ghana's
Finance
Minister
,
to
do
the
honours
as
host
,
in
which
capacity
he
held
a
reception
tonight
in
Accra's
Ambassador
Hotel
.
POLICE
,
on
direct
orders
from
the
Cabinet
,
are
openly
intimidating
members
of
Earl
Russell's
nuclear-
disarming
Committee
of
100
,
the
Committee
claimed
yesterday
.
It
said
pressure
was
being
put
on
members
and
associates
all
over
the
country
.
It
alleged
:
Phones
were
being
tapped
and
going
out
of
action
;
Police
were
visiting
people
"
on
no
pretext
whatsoever
,
except
to
pass
the
time
of
day
"
;
Supporters
had
been
warned
-
one
that
his
connection
with
the
committee
was
going
too
far
;
another
that
anti-apartheid
agitation
was
all
right
,
but
support
for
the
committee
was
not
.
A
third
man's
house
was
watched
for
four
days
by
plain-clothes
men
.
Committee-member
Mr.
George
Clark
commented
at
a
Press
conference
:
"
The
most
extraordinary
things
are
happening
.
"
Fifty
committee
members
will
appear
at
Bow-street
today
,
including
Lord
Russell
,
Lady
Russell
,
Lord
Boyd-Orr
,
the
Rev.
Michael
Scott
,
and
Mr.
Clark
.
They
are
required
to
show
why
they
should
not
be
bound
over
for
disturbing
the
peace
and
for
inciting
a
breach
of
the
peace
.
The
summonses
say
they
are
"
likely
to
persevere
in
such
unlawful
conduct
.
"
Lord
Russell
,
89
,
was
putting
his
affairs
in
order
,
and
packing
a
case
,
at
his
Chelsea
home
yesterday
.
His
secretary
,
American-born
Mr.
Ralph
Schoenman
,
said
:
"
He
is
not
going
to
agree
to
be
bound
over
.
That
will
probably
mean
jail
and
,
though
frail
,
he
is
very
fit
and
will
take
the
rigours
of
prison
in
his
stride
.
He
hopes
to
be
allowed
to
do
some
writing
.
"
Back
at
the
Press
conference
,
Mr.
Clark
said
two
committee
members
tried
a
"
plant
"
call
on
suspect
phone
.
They
discussed
a
sit-down
at
Watford
at
5.30
p.m.
-
none
was
planned
but
police
turned
up
.
Sir
Roy
Welensky
said
today
that
he
no
longer
accepted
the
good
faith
of
Mr.
Kenneth
Kaunda
.
Sir
Roy
,
Federal
Rhodesian
Prime
Minister
,
said
that
Mr.
Kaunda's
United
National
Independence
Party
was
a
monster
as
vicious
as
the
Zambia
National
Congress
,
which
was
led
by
Mr.
Kaunda
until
he
was
outlawed
in
1959
.
The
record
of
lawlessness
among
UNIP
supporters
went
back
a
long
way
,
Sir
Roy
told
the
Federal
Parliament
in
Salisbury
.
He
cited
cases
in
which
hundreds
of
UNIP
supporters
had
been
arrested
or
convicted
since
last
year
on
charges
of
creating
disturbances
.
During
the
first
three
weeks
of
the
present
trouble
287
incidents
had
been
reported
in
Northern
Rhodesia
.
More
than
500
people
-
167
of
them
members
of
the
UNIP
-
were
convicted
last
month
in
the
Northern
Province
alone
.
"
Against
this
background
must
be
taken
Mr.
Kaunda's
repeated
statements
that
all
he
is
doing
is
in
the
name
of
non-violence
,
"
said
Sir
Roy
.
"
I
am
now
compelled
to
say
that
I
don't
accept
his
good
faith
.
"
He
said
Mr.
Kaunda
must
know
that
his
statements
had
stimulated
violence
,
but
he
had
done
nothing
to
stop
it
.
"
It
is
true
he
made
a
point
of
again
being
absent
from
Northern
Rhodesia
when
his
followers
have
indulged
in
such
violence
.
"
But
Sir
Roy
pointed
out
that
a
few
months
ago
Mr.
Kaunda
said
that
if
UNIP
did
not
get
its
way
what
would
happen
would
make
the
Mau
Mau
in
Kenya
"
seem
like
a
child's
picnic
.

JOHN
DICKIE
writes
:
Mr.
Macmillan
gave
top
priority
to
the
clash
over
Northern
Rhodesia
on
his
return
from
Scotland
yesterday
.
He
summoned
Mr.
Iain
Macleod
,
Colonial
Secretary
,
and
Mr.
Duncan
Sandys
,
Commonwealth
Relations
Secretary
for
an
hour's
talks
at
Admiralty
House
.
A
statement
is
expected
today
to
hold
the
door
open
for
modifications
to
the
new
Constitution
provided
law
and
order
is
maintained
in
Northern
Rhodesia
.
Its
terms
have
set
the
Prime
Minister
an
exacting
problem
.
Mr.
Sandys
has
warned
of
the
risk
of
a
strong
reaction
from
Sir
Roy
Welensky
to
any
suggestion
that
there
may
be
fresh
concessions
to
the
African
nationalists
.
Mr.
Macleod
has
ample
evidence
from
talks
with
Sir
John
Moffat
,
Northern
Rhodesian
Liberal
leader
,
and
Mr.
Kaunda
,
that
the
bulk
of
moderates
and
Africans
will
reject
the
Constitution
unless
it
is
modified
.
A
ROYAL
welcome
for
the
Kabaka
of
Buganda
(
King
Freddie
)
from
Princess
Elizabeth
Bagaya
of
Toro
,
kneeling
at
the
foot
of
his
airliner's
steps
at
London
Airport
yesterday
.
Forty
other
Africans
greeted
him
,
kneeling
with
heads
bowed
.
The
princess
,
aged
24
,
is
now
studying
history
at
Cambri-
dge
,
where
she
is
a
friend
of
Prince
William
of
Gloucester
.
King
Freddie
and
three
other
hereditary
rulers
of
native
kingdoms
in
Uganda
arrived
for
talks
with
Colonial
Secretary
Mr.
Iain
Macleod
,
before
the
Uganda
Constitutional
conference
opens
next
Monday
.
The
question
:
Their
status
in
an
independent
Uganda
.
The
thorniest
problem
for
next
week's
conference
is
to
settle
the
relationships
between
them
and
the
rest
of
the
country
.
A
Government
report
has
recognised
their
rights
and
recommended
a
form
of
federal
association
,
but
the
four
kings
are
not
Instead
,
the
kings
will
remain
in
London
and
wait
to
hear
the
conference's
proposals
.
Then
their
views
will
be
transmitted
back
.
MR.
BUTLER
,
the
Home
Secretary
,
has
decided
to
meet
head-on
the
biggest
challenge
to
Government
authority
yet
presented
by
the
"
Ban-the-Bomb
"
demonstrators
.
Police
leave
has
been
cancelled
and
secret
plans
prepared
to
deal
with
the
mass
sit-down
rally
planned
for
Sunday
in
Parliament-square
by
the
Committee
of
100
,
the
anti-nuclear
arms
group
.
It
was
Mr.
Butler
who
authorised
action
which
ended
yesterday
in
32
members
of
the
Committee
of
100
being
imprisoned
for
inciting
a
breach
of
the
peace
.
The
committee's
president
89-year-old
Earl
Russell
and
his
61-year-old
wife
were
each
jailed
for
a
week
.
Playwrights
Arnold
Wesker
(
The
Kitchen
)
and
Robert
Bolt
(
The
Flowering
Cherry
)
were
jailed
for
a
month
.
The
possibility
that
the
Government
might
invoke
the
Public
Order
Act
,
1936
,
and
declare
the
whole
rally
illegal
-
whether
the
demonstrators
sit
down
or
not
-
was
being
discussed
in
Whitehall
last
night
.
It
was
last
used
a
year
ago
,
to
deal
with
the
St.
Pancras
rent
riots
.
Today
Mr.
Butler
will
have
talks
with
Police
Commissioner
Sir
Joseph
Simpson
to
draw
up
final
plans
for
the
"
Battle
of
Parliament
Square
.
"
Measures
agreed
so
far
include
:
1
.
A
mass
call-out
of
police
,
special
constables
and
reserves
,
with
750
policemen
posted
from
outlying
districts
to
stations
in
the
area
-
West
End
Central
,
Bow-street
,
and
Cannon-row
.
Today
,
for
example
,
the
Foreign
Minister
of
Indo-
nesia
arrived
in
Belgrade
as
the
guest
of
the
Yugoslav
Foreign
Minister
.
In
fact
such
Yugoslav
activity
has
been
#
particularly
intensified
in
the
past
year
or
so
and
though
so
far
,
apart
from
joint
action
in
the
United
Nations
,
these
exchanges
have
not
been
seen
on
any
wider
basis
,
President
Tito
is
known
for
some
time
to
have
favoured
a
conference
of
neutralist
leaders
.
The
wish
was
particularly
apparent
in
comments
on
the
occasion
of
the
conference
in
Casablanca
and
,
in
particular
,
in
Yugoslav
approval
of
the
idea
of
an
inter-African
consultative
assembly
which
would
coordinate
activity
on
the
political
and
economic
sphere
;
and
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
that
President
Tito
would
like
some
such
idea
extended
also
to
the
whole
uncommitted
world
But
he
now
feels
,
in
view
of
a
changed
international
situation
and
especially
in
view
of
fresh
problems
facing
the
new
and
independent
countries
of
Africa
,
that
the
time
is
ripe
to
have
more
frequent
consultations
between
the
uncommitted
countries
and
even
to
work
out
common
stands
on
various
problems
facing
those
nations
.
Two
subjects
,
the
Congo
and
Algeria
,
are
the
main
topics
of
the
talks
in
Belgrade
-
and
on
both
the
two
leaders
have
identical
ideas
.
Two
emissaries
from
the
Laotian
Government
of
Prince
Boun
Oum
have
arrived
in
Phnom
Penh
,
Cambodia
,
to
invite
Prince
Souvanna
Phouma
,
the
former
Prime
Min-
ister
,
to
return
to
Laos
.
No
details
of
their
mission
have
been
disclosed
,
but
it
was
reported
earlier
in
Laos
that
Prince
Boun
Oum
was
considering
asking
Prince
Souvanna
Phouma
to
join
his
Government
.
Prince
Souvanna
Phouma
has
not
yet
replied
to
the
mission
,
but
recent
statements
made
by
him
in
Phnom
Penh
indicate
that
he
still
regards
himself
as
the
only
legal
Prime
Minister
of
Laos
.
His
policy
of
strict
neutrality
from
1951
to
1958
kept
the
kingdom
in
peace
,
though
at
the
cost
of
virtual
partition
of
the
country
into
the
pro-communist
north
and
the
pro-western
centre
and
south
.
Prince
Souvanna's
former
Minister
of
Information
,
Mr.
Quinim
Pholsena
,
who
claims
to
be
his
representative
in
Laos
,
yesterday
addressed
all
officers
of
the
pro-communist
forces
occupying
the
province
of
Xieng
Khouang
and
emphasized
that
Prince
Souphannouvong
,
leader
of
the
pro-communist
Neo
Lao
Haksat
Party
,
also
to
the
officers
in
the
same
terms
.
This
emphasis
on
the
legality
of
the
former
Government
suggests
that
all
is
not
well
with
the
political
and
military
leadership
of
the
pro-communists
.
Most
of
the
province
of
Xieng
Khouang
and
the
tactically
useful
Plain
of
Jars
,
however
,
appear
still
to
be
firmly
in
their
hands
.
The
Government
has
claimed
the
recapture
of
Vang
Vieng
,
the
pro-
communists'
former
base
60
miles
north
of
Vientiane
,
but
this
claim
A
correspondent
who
travelled
yesterday
to
within
a
few
miles
of
Vang
Vieng
was
told
by
officers
that
this
village
was
still
held
by
the
pro-communists
.
With
the
Prime
Minister
sunning
himself
in
Jamaica
and
#
his
Cabinet
out
in
the
grass
roots
making
160
speeches
in
80
constituencies
in
10
days
,
the
Liberal
Party
are
holding
a
national
conference
here
with
some
2,000
delegates
,
the
biggest
gathering
since
1958
when
Mr.
Lester
Pearson
was
chosen
as
party
leader
.
In
some
ways
it
will
be
a
testing
occasion
for
him
,
although
some
think
his
position
unassailable
simply
because
there
is
no
one
else
in
sight
to
supplant
him
.
So
the
con-
ference
will
concentrate
on
laying
the
foundations
on
which
to
win
the
next
election
.
The
rally
comes
at
a
time
when
in
spite
of
carefully
worded
state-
ments
by
the
Prime
Minister
there
is
an
air
of
electoral
expectancy
.
Members
of
the
Cabinet
are
basing
their
speeches
on
a
new
Conservative
booklet
called
The
Record
Speaks
which
outlines
in
some
detail
the
accomplishments
of
the
party
since
it
came
to
office
three
and
a
half
years
ago
.
Nevertheless
there
is
little
illusion
in
the
Conservative
Party
that
their
stock
at
home
has
fallen
in
the
face
of
heavy
unemployment
and
an
uncertain
economy
.
Last
year
saw
the
defeat
of
two
Conservative
provincial
governments
,
Quebec
and
New
Brunswick
,
and
in
the
four
federal
by-elections
last
October
the
party
fared
badly
.
They
are
now
faced
with
four
other
by-
elections
,
one
at
Esquimalt
Saanich
,
British
Columbia
,
one
in
Leeds
,
Ontario
,
and
the
other
two
in
the
Maritimes
-
Restigouche
Madawaska
,
New
Brunswick
,
and
Kings
,
Prince
Edward
Island
.
All
four
were
Conservative
strongholds
.
Last
September
a
public
poll
showed
that
for
the
first
time
since
the
Administration
came
to
power
in
1957
the
Liberals
were
ahead
(
43
per
cent
were
in
favour
of
"
The
Grits
"
if
a
federal
election
had
been
held
last
autumn
,
38
per
cent
for
the
Conservatives
and
12
per
cent
for
the
C.C.F.
)
.
However
,
a
separate
poll
revealed
that
Mr.
Diefenbaker
was
still
ahead
in
terms
of
popularity
as
an
individual
leader
(
for
Mr.
Diefenbaker
36
per
cent
,
for
Mr.
Pearson
34
per
cent
)
.
How
far
is
Mr.
Lester
Pearson
acceptable
to
the
people
of
Canada
as
a
Prime
Minister
?
Many
observers
at
the
national
rally
will
be
seeking
an
answer
.
It
is
difficult
for
many
to
see
Mr.
Pearson
in
the
role
of
a
popular
orator
at
the
hustings
,
the
spellbinder
that
Mr.
Diefen-
baker
was
in
the
last
two
campaigns
.
The
impression
remains
that
the
Liberal
leader
is
still
the
diplomatist
,
more
at
home
in
the
chancery
,
or
the
corridors
of
the
United
Nations
,
not
the
father
figure
,
so
necessary
in
Canadian
leadership
,
or
the
practical
politician
,
able
to
talk
about
sewage
problems
in
Algoma
East
.
On
the
other
hand
,
Mr.
Pearson
excels
in
meeting
people
informally
,
but
many
still
regard
him
"
as
some
sort
of
cross
between
an
egghead
and
a
missionary
"
.
His
party
advisers
are
now
trying
to
correct
that
image
.
The
bow
tie
has
gone
;
he
is
having
lessons
on
television
techniques
and
is
being
coached
by
speech
experts
.
Everything
is
being
done
to
promote
a
new
image
.
Certainly
,
he
is
now
a
much
lessly
trounced
by
Mr.
Diefen-
baker
in
the
House
in
those
early
days
.
It
has
been
a
hard
road
back
but
now
,
with
plenty
of
political
ammunition
given
him
by
the
Gov-
ernment
in
recent
sessions
,
he
is
leading
the
Opposition
with
skill
and
assurance
and
is
a
match
for
the
Prime
Minister
across
the
floor
.

Mr.
Pearson
is
now
talking
about
"
his
new
and
dynamic
liberalism
"
and
this
week
will
#
show
perhaps
how
far
"
Mike
will
go
.
The
main
topic
under
review
is
unemployment
,
but
there
will
be
21
committees
examining
subjects
ranging
from
foreign
investment
in
Canada
to
the
problems
of
the
Atlantic
provinces
.
However
,
be
this
election
year
or
not
,
Mr.
Pearson
,
with
his
party
increasingly
confident
of
return
to
power
,
Sentence
Database
Mr.
Thorneycroft
,
the
Minister
of
Aviation
,
who
arrives
in
Bonn
tomorrow
for
talks
with
the
Federal
Government
on
a
European
space
satellite
project
,
will
find
the
Germans
interested
in
the
principle
of
space
research
,
but
rather
sceptical
about
British
plans
for
organizing
it
.
Stated
more
bluntly
,
they
are
still
unconvinced
that
this
is
not
primarily
an
effort
on
Britain's
part
to
salve
Blue
Streak
,
which
was
abandoned
last
summer
as
a
military
project
;
or
that
the
European
space
satellite
is
indeed
to
be
purely
scientific
in
character
.
Mr.
Thorneycroft's
main
purpose
will
be
to
remove
these
doubts
,
and
to
persuade
the
Federal
Government
that
the
financial
burden
involved
is
really
worth
while
,
at
a
time
when
any
increase
in
budgetary
commitments
would
almost
certainly
involve
a
corresponding
rise
in
taxation
-
something
no
one
is
prepared
to
contemplate
in
an
election
year
.
But
,
at
the
same
time
,
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
Federal
Government
is
not
convinced
,
on
the
basis
of
the
information
it
has
so
far
,
that
such
a
project
would
be
justified
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
;
and
not
merely
constitute
a
"
prestige
"
satellite
,
duplicating
to
some
extent
American
efforts
,
as
Die
Welt
suggests
today
in
a
highly
critical
editorial
article
.
On
the
specific
question
of
the
use
of
Blue
Streak
,
Mr.
Thorneycroft's
task
will
be
easier
.
He
can
point
out
that
this
is
the
only
rocket
and
launcher
in
Europe
to
have
reached
a
sufficient
stage
of
development
for
adaptation
as
the
first
stage
in
putting
a
heavy
satellite
into
outer
space
.
There
has
also
been
some
talk
of
adopting
another
British
rocket
,
Black
Knight
,
for
the
second
stage
,
but
the
French
have
one
of
their
own
called
Veronique
which
they
would
like
to
see
used
.
The
Foreign
Ministry
spokesman
added
today
,
however
,
that
the
Brussels
Treaty
was
irrelevant
,
because
research
on
the
various
rocket
stages
had
already
been
concluded
,
and
only
cooperation
on
the
type
of
capsule
was
involved
.
A
lesser
obstacle
to
German
participation
is
the
absence
of
any
Ministry
or
Minister
directly
responsible
for
it
-
and
therefore
of
any
budget
under
which
funds
could
be
appropriated
.
This
is
expected
eventually
to
replace
the
Fiat
G-91
,
and
the
F
104
Starfighter
,
the
backbone
of
the
German
Air
Force
.
PRESIDENT
KENNEDY
renewed
his
pressure
on
Mr.
Harold
Macmillan
to
join
the
Common
Market
during
their
talks
at
Admiralty
House
,
Whitehall
,
yesterday
.
Much
of
their
three
hours
,
20
minutes
of
discussion
is
believed
to
have
been
devoted
to
this
main
point
of
American
policy
.
It
arose
during
talks
following
President
Kennedy's
report
to
the
British
Prime
Minister
of
the
outcome
of
his
recent
visit
to
Paris
.
There
General
de
Gaulle
had
made
clear
that
he
would
accept
Britain
into
the
Common
Market
only
if
there
were
no
conditions
laid
down
to
meet
the
Commonwealth
and
other
reservations
.
Mr.
Kennedy
told
Mr.
Macmillan
that
he
still
wanted
him
to
apply
for
membership
of
the
Common
Market
,
even
if
it
meant
an
unconditional
surrender
.
There
were
also
brief
discussions
on
Laos
,
Berlin
and
other
foreign
questions
,
after
Mr.
Kennedy
had
informed
Mr.
Macmillan
of
his
discussions
with
Mr.
Krushchov
.
With
the
exception
of
40
minutes
when
Lord
Home
,
Foreign
Secretary
,
and
Mr.
McGeorge
Bundy
,
the
President's
special
assistant
for
security
affairs
,
were
brought
in
,
the
two
men
talked
alone
.
An
attempt
to
get
more
information
about
the
Admiralty
House
meeting
will

for
a
statement

President
Kennedy
flew
from
London
Airport
last
night
to
arrive
in
Washington
this
morning
.
He
is
to
make
a
30-minute
nation-wide
broadcast
and
television
report
on
his
talks
with
Mr.
Krushchov
this
evening
.
The
joint
communique
on
Mr.
Kennedy's
and
Mr.
Macmillan's
third
talks
-
the
first
were
at
Key
West
,
Florida
,
the
second
in
Washington
-
said
:
"
Their
discussions
covered
the
major
problems
,
both
economic
and
political
,
and
revealed
once
again
the
close
agreement
of
the
two
Governments
in
pursuing
their
common
purposes
.
"
Occasion
was
given
to
review
the
need
for
economic
co-operation
and
expansion
in
the
general
interests
of
developed
and
underdeveloped
countries
alike
.
"
It
said
that
the
President
and
Premier
noted
"
with
satisfaction
"
the
agreement
in
Vienna
on
the
need
for
an
effective
Laos
ceasefire
,
which
should
lead
to
progress
toward
a
Laos
agreement
at
the
Geneva
conference
.
"
Particular
attention
was
also
given
to
the
nuclear
tests
conference
and
to
the
question
of
disarmament
.
"
The
situation
in
regard
to
Germany
was
reviewed
,
and
there
was
full
agreement
on
the
necessity
of
maintaining
the
rights
and
obligations
of
the
allied
Governments
in
Berlin
.

from
their
formal
Admiralty
House
talks
,
followed
by
lunch
given
by
Lady
Dorothy
Macmillan
with
Mrs.
Kennedy
and
other
guests
present
,
Mr.
Kennedy
and
Mr.
Macmillan
met
three
more
times
yesterday
.
In
PARIS
,
Mr.
Dean
Rusk
,
U.S.
Secretary
of
State
,
gave
a
90-minute
briefing
on
the
Vienna
talks
to
the
15-nation
Nato
council
.
Some
of
his
listeners
said
he
was
"
rather
pessimistic
"
and
talked
of
a
Berlin
crisis
later
this
year
.
From
Nato
headquarters
Mr.
Rusk
went
to
see
President
de
Gaulle
and
informed
him
of
the
Vienna
outcome
.
Last
night
Mr.
Rusk
arrived
in
London
in
time
to
join
the
Buckingham
Palace
dinner
and
to
fly
home
with
the
President
.
In
DUESSELDORF
,
Chancellor
Adenauer
said
the
Vienna
talks
"
might
be
the
beginning
of
a
slight
improvement
,
"
but
no
big
changes
should
be
expected
in
the
political
situation
.
RELAXED
,
smiling
and
clearly
in
the
best
of
spirits
,
Mr.
Krushchov
yesterday
returned
to
Moscow
after
his
two
days
of
talks
with
President
Kennedy
,
writes
Dennis
Ogden
from
Moscow
.
The
good
beginning
made
at
Vienna
must
be
followed
up
by
new
efforts
for
peace
,
the
Soviet
Communist
Party
newspaper
Pravda
declared
yesterday
.
Events
in
Vienna
"
gave
hope
to
people
of
goodwill
who
hate
the
cold
war
,
and
to
all
who
are
striving
for
a
stable
peace
,
"
"

over
the
results
of
the
Vienna
meeting
,
peace-loving
people
will
say
'
a
good

Mr.
Krushchov
remained
at
the
airport
to
join
President
Brezhnev
in
welcoming
Dr.
Sukarno
,
President
and
Prime
Minister
of

who
arrived
by

visit
40
minutes
after

before
flying
off
to
Moscow
,
Mr.

said
he
hoped
his
weekend
talks
with

Kennedy
would
#
help
"
to
establish
an
enduring
peace

"
Replying
to
a
farewell
speech
from
Austrian
President
Schaerf
,
the
Soviet
Premier
thanked
Austria
for
the
hospitality
and
welcome
he
had
received
.
"
The
Soviet
Union
has
always
striven
and
is
striving
to
safeguard
an
enduring
peace
for
the
peoples
,
to
secure
an
early
solution
of
the
MR.
GAITSKELL
today
delivered
a
full-blooded
defence
of
the
Polaris
missile
base
.
And
by
implication
he
supported
the
establishment
of
sites
in
Britain
for
the
training
of
German
troops
.
His
main
theme
was
that
nuclear
weapons
were
necessary
to
defend
Britain
,
that
Britain
must
depend
on
Nato
and
"
the
West
"
must
have
nuclear
weapons
so
long
as
the
Soviet
Union
has
them
.
Addressing
the
annual
congress
of
the
National
Union
of
General
and
Municipal
Workers
,
he
said
he
felt
sure
the
Labour
movement
was
coming
round
in
support
of
his
views
.
Obviously
conscious
of
the
fierce
and
widespread
resentment
over
the
U.S.
Polaris
base
in
Britain
,
Mr.
Gaitskell
said
that
he
even
noticed
that
supporters
of
unilateral
nuclear
disarmament
were
changing
their
tactics
by
switching
most
of
their
emphasis
on
to
the
missile
.
Mr
Gaitskell
said
that
a
member
of
an
alliance
could
not
deny
facilities
to
nations
to
which
it
was
allied
.
But
governments
should
be
free
to
negotiate
and
refuse
proposals
with
which
they
did
not
agree
.
The
Labour
Party
opposed
Thor
missiles
,
because
,
he
said
,
they
were
out
of
date
and
vulnerable
and
would
attract
enemy
action
.
That
argument
did
not
apply
to
the
Polaris
submarine
.
So
long
as
the
Soviet
Union
had
nuclear
weapons
,
the
West
,
somewhere
,
must
have
them
too
.
It
was
far
better
for
a
weapon
used
for
retaliatory
purposes
to
be
under
the
sea
rather
than
on
land
.
This
was
why
the
Labour
Party
did
not
think
it
right
to
oppose
the
Polaris
depot
ship
.
The
party
agreed
that
it
was
unwise
to
locate
the
base
in
the
Holy
Loch
,
only
30
miles
from
Glasgow
,
a
city
with
two
million
people
.
It
should
be
sited
in
a
more
remote
area
.
Mr.
Gaitskell
added
that
the
Scarborough
conference
decisions
did
not
,
in
his
view
,
truly
reflect
the
opinions
of
the
majority
of
party
members
and
still
less
the
party's
supporters
in
the
country
.
Mr
Gaitskell
added
that
agreement
with
the
unilateralists
was
not
possible
,
though
he
respected
their
views
.
He
saw
by
reports
that
"
those
who
organise
these
things
"
were
recommending
the
supporters
of
unilateral
nuclear
disarmament
to
shift
the
emphasis
of
their
intervention
away
from
straight
opposition
to
the
official
document
on
to
opposition
to
the
Polaris
base
.
To
Mr.
Macmillan
,
Mr
Gaitskell
said
the
Prime
Minister
should
begin
to
take
seriously
the
danger
of
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
within
the
Nato
alliance
.
"
Let
us
say
to
Macmillan
that
he
should
press
,
I
hope
with
the
agreement
of
Kennedy
,
in
talks
with
the
Soviet
Union
,
for
the
establishment
in
central
Europe
of
a
zone
of
controlled
disarmament
.
"
He
thought
,
he
said
,
that
the
Soviet
Union
would
be
prepared
to
reach
an
agreement
on
a
zone
of
controlled
disarmament
in
Europe
.
Mr
Gaitskell
concluded
,
declaring
that
the
present
was
the
beginning
of
a
great
period
of
opportunity
for
the
party
.
It
was
a
great
chance
that
should
be
grasped
.
Inter-union
jealousies
prevent
the
fulfilment
of
a
common
policy
for
wages
and
other
major
questions
,
Mr.
Jack
Cooper
The
General
Council
of
the
Trades
Union
Congress
should
therefore
consider
the
matter
.
Consideration
should
also
be
given
to
the
regrouping
of
unions
and
the
modification
of
their
structures
to
meet
the
growing
concentration
of
capital
.
Mr.
Cooper
argued
that
a
common
industrial
contribution
was
urgent
-
particularly
in

serving

-
along
Suggesting
that
a
total
T.U.C.
membership
of
eight
million
was
a
"
poor
show
"
compared
with
some
countries
,
he
argued
that
the
position
needed
examination
.
BEFORE
President
Kennedy
met
Mr.
Macmillan
yesterday
morning
he
was
given
the
views
of
a
wide
section
of
the
British
people
about
Polaris
submarine
bases
in
this
country
.
An
open
letter
written
by
Earl
Russell
hoping
that
the
Earl
Russell
,
President
of
the
Committee
of
100
,
told
Kennedy
that
he
should
take
notice
of
"
that
very
large
and
growing
section
which
is
opposed
to
the
establishment
of
a
Polaris
base
,
whether
at
Holy
Loch
or
elsewhere
on
British
territory
.
"
He
pointed
out
that
already
there
have
been
protests
but
that
"
very
much
larger
protests
are
to
be
expected
and
are
being
planned
.
"
There
are
three
kinds
of
reasons
that
justify
the
protests
and
these
should
carry
weight
with
the
U.S.
Government
,
Earl
Russell
suggested
.
"
The
first
of
these
reasons
is
the
importance
of
pre-
serving
the
hitherto
cordial
relations
between
the
U.S.
and
Great
Britain
,
not
only
in
Government
circles
,
but
in
public
opinion
.
"
Earl
Russell
says
it
is
inevitable
,
though
profoundly
regrettable
,
that
the
agitation
against
the
Polaris
base
has
generated
some
antagonism
to
the
policy
of
the
United
States
.
The
second
reason
is
concerned
with
doubts
as
to
the
safety
of
the
people
of
Great
Britain
;
"
in
the
time
of
crisis
it
would
probably
be
impossible
for
the
British
authorities
to
exercise
any
degree
of
control
over
the
action
of
Polaris
submarines
.
"
He
argues
that
there
is
a
distinct
possibility
that
so
long
as
there
is
a
Polaris
base
in
Britain
the
Soviet
Union
might
retaliate
against
Britain
alone
.
"
Such
retaliation
might
,
and
probably
would
,
destroy
the
whole
population
of
Britain
in
the
course
of
,
at
the
most
,
an
hour
"
without
provoking
American
retaliation
.
Earl
Russell
believes
:
"
It
is
very
questionable
whether
British
membership
of
Nato
and
British
permission
of
American
bases
on
our
territory
add
anything
to
the
strength
of
America
,
while
,
on
the
contrary
,
they
impose
upon
America
an
onerous
obligation
which
it
may
prove
impossible
to
fulfil
.
"
The
third
reason
is
that
the
supreme
interest
for
the
whole
world
-
East
and
West
and
uncommitted
nations
-
is
the
prevention
of
nuclear
war
.
"
A
rapidly
growing
body
of
opinion
in
this
country
believes
that
Britain
could
be
more
effective
in
preventing
a
nuclear
war
as
a
neutral
by
helping
to
suggest
agreements
which
could
be
accepted
by
both
East
and
West
.
